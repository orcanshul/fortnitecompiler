fortnite compiler to compile uhhh?

Use the following:
Docker (Reccomended to self host containers of qdrant and the project itself, but you can customize it)
Python (:/)
Ollama (you can change this out with an OpenAI API key / Gemini Key / anything to win hackythings)
basic understanding of langchain
REQUIREMENTS:
You can change off the models that you would like to use on streamlit itself. However, make sure to have said model(s) on your local machine
Atleast 8GB Ram is reccomended, the higher the better (I could barely run Mistral but if you have higher specs definetly run the GPToss)
uh yeah

use this to become 10x hackything champion + ego
Also highly reccomend running in python 3.11, as PyArrow is not initialized for the later ver. of Python.


(make your own venv and run pip install -r requirements.txt to get all of the required plugins)
